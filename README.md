# Anbeeld's BeeLlama.cpp

![BeeLlama.cpp logo](beellama.jpg)

BeeLlama.cpp (or just Bee) is a performance-focused llama.cpp fork for squeezing more speed and context out of local GGUF inference. It keeps the familiar llama.cpp tools and server flow, then adds DFlash speculative decoding, adaptive draft control, TurboQuant/TCQ KV-cache compression, and reasoning-loop protection, with full multimodal support.

> Not quite a pegasus, but close enough.

## Fork Features

- **DFlash speculative decoding**: `--spec-type dflash` drives a DFlash draft GGUF alongside the target model. The target captures hidden states into a ring buffer, the drafter cross-attends to the most recent `--spec-dflash-cross-ctx` hidden-state tokens and proposes drafts for target verification.
- **Adaptive draft-max control**: The server adjusts the active draft horizon at runtime instead of using a fixed `--spec-draft-n-max`. The default `profit` controller compares speculative throughput against a no-spec baseline, the `fringe` alternative maps acceptance-rate bands to draft depth.
- **Full multimodal support**: When `--mmproj` is active, the server keeps DFlash available for text generation. The model can be fully offloaded to CPU with no problems to reduce VRAM pressure.
- **TurboQuant / TCQ KV-cache compression**: Five cache types (`turbo2`, `turbo3`, `turbo4`, `turbo2_tcq`, `turbo3_tcq`) spanning from 4x to 7.5x compression, with TCQ types offering good precision for their size. Set independently with `--cache-type-k` and `--cache-type-v`.
- **Reasoning-loop protection**: The server detects repeated hidden reasoning output and intervenes. Default mode is `force-close`, with `--reasoning-loop-window` and `--reasoning-loop-max-period` tuning available.
- **Sampled DFlash verification**: `--spec-draft-temp` enables rejection-sampling drafter behavior. Activates when both draft and target temperature exceed zero. Draft log probabilities must be available for rejection sampling to produce correct output.
- **DDTree branch verification**: optional `--spec-branch-budget` adds branch nodes beyond the main draft path with GPU `parent_ids`, tree masks, and recurrent tree kernels. Disabled automatically when the target model spans more than one GPU. This one is very much work in progress!
- **Request-level speculative overrides**: Draft-max and branch budget can be overridden per-request through JSON fields without restarting the server.
- **CopySpec model-free speculation**: `--spec-type copyspec` provides rolling-hash suffix matching over previous tokens without a draft model.

TurboQuant (WHT-based scalar quantization) originates from [TheTom/llama-cpp-turboquant](https://github.com/TheTom/llama-cpp-turboquant). TCQ (Trellis-Coded Quantization) and basic DFlash implementation originate from [spiritbuun/buun-llama-cpp](https://github.com/spiritbuun/buun-llama-cpp) (paper: [Closing the Gap: Trellis-Coded Quantization for KV Cache at 2-3 Bits](https://huggingface.co/datasets/spiritbuun/turboquant-tcq-kv-cache)).

## DFlash Speedup

DFlash is strongest on structured, repetitive generation: code, tests, boilerplate, JSON-like formats, and other low-entropy continuations. Open-ended prose is much less predictable, so gains are smaller.

Include comprehensive docstrings, type hints, and pytest unit tests for every method. Return only the code, no commentary.
```

**Multi-turn coding**

**Turn 1**

```text
Build an async WebSocket gateway for telemetry devices. Use Python 3.12 style typing.

Return exactly one labeled code block per requested file. Label each code block with a file header like `# ws_gateway/router.py`; outside code blocks, use at most one short sentence per file explaining why it exists. Assume this is a chat response only: do not mention saving files or accessing a filesystem.

Return code blocks for:
- `ws_gateway/models.py`: dataclasses/enums for `Topic`, `OutboundMessage`, `AckState`, `ClientId`, and `MetricSnapshot`
- `ws_gateway/metrics.py`: small standard-library metrics collector with counters/gauges and a Prometheus text export method
- `ws_gateway/errors.py`: error types for invalid topics, duplicate subscriptions, queue overflow policy errors, and closed sessions
- `ws_gateway/config.py`: immutable config dataclass for queue depth, ping interval, ack timeout, and rate limits

Keep prose brief and adjacent to the code. Do not write a separate architecture essay. Do not add extra files, alternate designs, or optional extensions.
```

**Turn 2**

```text
Now implement the topic router and subscriber queues. Return code-first output only: labeled code blocks plus brief inline notes if needed.

Return code blocks for:
- `ws_gateway/router.py`
- `tests/test_router.py`

Requirements:
- MQTT-like topics with `+` for one segment and `#` for the remaining suffix
- `subscribe`, `unsubscribe`, `publish`, `drain`, and `close_subscriber`
- stable per-subscriber ordering
- bounded per-subscriber queues with drop-oldest backpressure using a per-subscriber `deque(maxlen=...)`
- injectable clock for tests
- metrics updates for publishes, deliveries, drops, and active subscriptions
- pytest tests for wildcard matching, ordering, unsubscribe cleanup, and queue overflow

Use only the standard library in runtime code. Stay within the names and structure already established unless this prompt explicitly changes them.
```

**Turn 3**

```text
Add the connection/session layer over the router. Keep the answer mostly code: labeled code blocks and tests, no standalone design section.

Return code blocks for:
- `ws_gateway/session.py`
- `tests/test_session.py`

Implement:
- `ClientSession` with user id, connection id, subscribed topics, last pong time, pending ack ids, and lifecycle state
- `WebSocketLike` protocol with `send_json`, `close`, and `ping`
- `ConnectionManager` that accepts an authenticated session, starts/stops tasks, maps users to sessions, and unsubscribes on disconnect
- outbound delivery loop from subscriber queue to websocket
- ping/pong keepalive with zombie detection at 3x interval
- incoming token-bucket rate limiter at 10 messages/sec with burst 20
- tests for clean disconnect, zombie close, slow consumer drops, and rate limit rejection

Reuse the exact names and APIs already established unless this prompt explicitly changes them.
```

**Turn 4**

```text
Wire the service boundary. Keep prose to one-line notes beside code blocks.

Return code blocks for:
- `ws_gateway/app.py`: aiohttp app factory, websocket handler skeleton, health/readiness handlers, JWT verifier protocol, and graceful shutdown hooks
- `ws_gateway/persistence.py`: minimal ack persistence protocol plus an in-memory implementation for tests
- `tests/test_app_lifecycle.py`: tests for shutdown order, readiness false when persistence is unhealthy, and ack drain on disconnect
- `docs/load_test_plan.md`: concise checklist only, no paragraphs

Keep handlers thin and concrete. Do not introduce extra modules or abstractions beyond the listed files. The shutdown order and dependency boundaries must be concrete in code. Reuse the exact names and APIs already established unless this prompt explicitly changes them.
```

**Turn 5**

```text
Patch the code from this conversation. Output only chat-safe patch content: one short comment line per issue, then a unified diff or replacement snippet, then a pytest test. No separate review prose and no filesystem instructions.

Fix the top 5 concrete correctness problems likely in this gateway:
- leaked delivery or keepalive tasks on disconnect
- duplicate subscription state after reconnect
- unfair drop-oldest behavior across hot and cold topics
- ack persistence race during shutdown
- readiness or metrics reporting success while internal tasks are failing

For each fix, include:
1. a one-line bug label as a code comment
2. the smallest Python diff or replacement snippet
3. one focused pytest test that fails before the fix

Stay within the existing file labels and APIs.
```

## KV Cache Quantization

K and V cache types are set independently with `--cache-type-k` and `--cache-type-v`. For benchmark details, see [KV Cache Quantization Benchmarks for Long Context](https://anbeeld.com/articles/kv-cache-quantization-benchmarks-for-long-context).

### Preset Ladder

| K / V | % of bf16 size | 99.9% precision | What it is for |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| bf16 / bf16 | 100 | 100.0% | Preserving full quality |
| q8_0 / q8_0 | 53.1 | 94.6% | Compression with minimal losses |
| **q8_0 / q5_1** | **45.3** | **94.2%** | **Great precision/size at high end** |
| q8_0 / q5_0 | 43.8 | 93.7% | If q8_0 / q5_1 doesn't fit just a bit |
| q5_0 / q5_0 | 34.4 | 92.7% | Good precision/size, relatively safe |
| **q5_0 / q4_1** | **32.8** | **92.6%** | **Best default if VRAM-constrained** |
| q5_0 / q4_0 | 31.3 | 91.4% | If q5_0 / q4_1 doesn't fit just a bit |
| q4_0 / q4_0 | 28.1 | 89.8% | Memory saving with precision loss |
| q4_0 / turbo3_tcq | 24.2 | 84.9% | Smaller than q4, cleaner than turbo3_tcq |
| **turbo3_tcq / turbo3_tcq** | **20.3** | **81.6%** | **Viable as extreme compression** |
| turbo2_tcq / turbo2_tcq | 14.1 | 54.4% | Last resort: not for code and tool calls |

*99.9% precision = `100 · exp(−(quantKLD − bf16KLD))` at the 99.9% KL-divergence tail.*

### Type Reference

| Type | Origin | bpv | Diff vs bf16 | Notes |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| q8_0 | upstream | 8.5 | 1.88× | High-fidelity K or V |
| q5_1 | upstream | 6 | 2.67× | Conservative, might be better for V than q5_0 |
| q5_0 | upstream | 5.5 | 2.91× | Strong K type for VRAM constrained configs |
| q4_1 | upstream | 5 | 3.2× | Smaller than q5_0, but weaker in the tail. Prefer q5_0 for K |
| q4_0 | upstream | 4.5 | 3.56× | Default high compression type, decent at its size |
| turbo4 | fork | 4.125 | 3.88× | Barely smaller than q4_0, slower, worse tail |
| turbo3_tcq | fork | 3.25 | 4.92× | Viable compact mode, 82% precision at KLD 99.9%. CUDA-only |
| turbo3 | fork | 3.125 | 5.12× | Weaker than turbo3_tcq. Use only when TCQ is unavailable |
| turbo2_tcq | fork | 2.25 | 7.11× | Last resort, 54% precision at KLD 99.9%. CUDA-only |
| turbo2 | fork | 2.125 | 7.53× | Extreme quality risk. Use only when TCQ is unavailable |

## Installation

### Quickstart: DFlash on a Single GPU

For a step-by-step walkthrough with Qwen 3.6 on a 24 GB NVIDIA card (RTX 3090/4090, etc.), see [docs/quickstart-qwen36-dflash.md](docs/quickstart-qwen36-dflash.md). It covers model download, prebuilt binaries, and a tuned launch command.

### Prebuilt (Windows)

Download the release archive for your CUDA version (12.4 or 13.1) from the [releases page](https://github.com/Anbeeld/beellama.cpp/releases). Extract it. The server binary is `llama-server.exe`. Don't forget to download a separate archive with CUDA libraries and place it in the same folder!

Building from source with `-DGGML_NATIVE=ON` *may* result in a *tiny* bit better performance, so it might still be a good idea to do that if/when you decide to use this fork long-term.

### CUDA Build

```bash
# Linux (GCC + CUDA)
cmake -B build -DGGML_CUDA=ON -DGGML_NATIVE=ON \
  -DGGML_CUDA_FA=ON -DGGML_CUDA_FA_ALL_QUANTS=ON \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build -j

# Windows (MSVC + CUDA)
cmake -B build -DGGML_CUDA=ON -DGGML_NATIVE=ON ^
  -DGGML_CUDA_FA=ON -DGGML_CUDA_FA_ALL_QUANTS=ON ^
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build --config Release --parallel

# macOS (Metal)
cmake -B build -DGGML_METAL=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build -j
```

`GGML_CUDA_FA_ALL_QUANTS=ON` is required for TurboQuant and TCQ cache types. Add `-DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=86` for RTX 3090, or `-DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=89` for RTX 4090, if cross-compiling or building in CI without a GPU.

### Other Backends

Bee inherits llama.cpp backend support, including Metal, HIP, Vulkan, SYCL, BLAS, CANN, MUSA, OpenVINO, OpenCL, and RPC. Use the upstream-style build docs in [docs/build.md](docs/build.md) and backend-specific pages under [docs/backend](docs/backend).

## Common Commands

### Local CLI

```sh
llama-cli -m model.gguf
llama-cli -m model.gguf -cnv --chat-template chatml
llama-cli -m model.gguf -n 256 --grammar-file grammars/json.gbnf -p "Request: schedule a call at 8pm; Command:"
```

### OpenAI-Compatible Server

```sh
llama-server -m model.gguf --port 8080
llama-server -m model.gguf -c 16384 -np 4
llama-server -m model.gguf -md draft.gguf
```

### DFlash And TurboQuant Together

```sh
llama-server -m target.gguf --spec-type dflash \
  --spec-draft-model drafter.gguf \
  --spec-draft-ngl all \
  --flash-attn on --cache-type-k turbo4 --cache-type-v turbo3_tcq
```
